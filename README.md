# HPC_project

## TODO
* separate functions in at least 2 C sources file
* write a makefile


## MPI
### 1st version
* Only distribute the first level

### 2nd version
* Distribution on the first level, alternate active options 


## Code coverage
* Mention it in the report
* [Gcov tuto](https://emblddedinn.xyz/articles/tutorial/test-coverage-analysis-with-gcov/) 

## Optimization ideas
* Two layers: MPI + OpenMP: first distribute then parallelize
* Count number of times in different sectons of the program
